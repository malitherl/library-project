In this project, I will be creating a calculator capable of several functions, and these include: multiplication, addition, subtraction, and division. I will be using HTML DOM to render the calculator onto the page, and all buttons and will allow the user to input numbers and perform operations. The Javascript will be used to manage the calculations through nested functions.
